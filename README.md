# Chapter-5-6
Continue with your design from Chapter-4-3 and add some of the functionality demonstrated in this chapter. 

Some options:
	- Make parts of your design rollovers that change color when the mouse is over certain areas.
	- Move it around the screen. Can you make it bounce off all edges of the window?
	- Fade colors in and out.
